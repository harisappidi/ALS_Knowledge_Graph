37975798,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects adults, characterized by muscle weakness resulting from the specific death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. The pathogenesis of ALS is associated with the accumulation of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) proteins and neurofilaments in motor neurons, highlighting the critical need for disease-modifying treatments. Current therapies, such as riluzole and edaravone, provide only symptomatic relief. Recently, tofersen gained approval from the US FDA under the brand name Qalsody as the first and only gene therapy for ALS, addressing a significant pathological aspect of the disease.",2023
37870685,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is one of the commonest neurodegenerative diseases of adult-onset, which is characterized by the progressive death of motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. The dysfunction and death of motor neurons lead to the progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, fasciculations, spasticity and ultimately the whole paralysis of body. Despite the identification of several genetic mutations associated with the pathogenesis of ALS, including mutations in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 leading to the abnormal expansion of GGGGCC repeat sequence, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and TANK-binding kinase 1, the exact mechanisms underlying the specific degeneration of motor neurons that causes ALS remain incompletely understood. At present, since the transgenic model expressed SOD1 mutants was established, multiple in vitro models of ALS have been developed for studying the pathology, pathophysiology and pathogenesis of ALS as well as searching the effective neurotherapeutics. This review reviewed the details of present established in vitro models used in studying the pathology, pathophysiology and pathogenesis of ALS. Meanwhile, we also discussed the advantages, disadvantages, cost and availability of each models.",2023
37768183,"Increased amplitude of persistent inward currents (PICs) is observed in pre-symptomatic genetically modified SOD1 mice models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, at the symptomatic stage this reverses and there is a large reduction in PIC amplitude. It remains unclear whether these changes in PICs can be observed in humans, with cross-sectional studies in humans reporting contradictory findings. In people with ALS, we estimated the PIC contribution to self-sustained firing of motoneurons, using the paired-motor unit analysis to calculate the Δfrequency (ΔF), to compare the weaker and stronger muscles during the course of disease. We hypothesised that, with disease progression, ΔFs would relatively increase in the stronger muscles; and decline in the weaker muscles. Forty-three individuals with ALS were assessed in two occasions on average 17 weeks apart. Tibialis anterior high-density electromyograms were recorded during dorsiflexion (40% of maximal capacity) ramped contractions, followed by clinical tests. ∆F increased from 3.14 (2.57, 3.71) peaks per second (pps) to 3.55 (2.94, 4.17) pps on the stronger muscles (0.41 (0.041, 0.781) pps, standardised difference (d) = 0.287 (0.023, 0.552), P = 0.030). ∆F reduced from 3.38 (95% CI 2.92, 3.84) pps to 2.88 (2.40, 3.36) pps on the weaker muscles (-0.50 (-0.80, -0.21) pps, d = 0.353 (0.138, 0.567), P = 0.001). The ALSFRS-R score reduced 3.9 (2.3, 5.5) points. These data indicate that the contribution of PICs to motoneuron self-sustained firing increases over time in early stages of the disease when there is little weakness before decreasing as the disease progresses and muscle weakness exacerbates, in alignment with the findings from studies using SOD1 mice. KEY POINTS: Research on mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suggests that the amplitude of persistent inward currents (PICs) is increased in early stages before decreasing as the disease progresses. Cross-sectional studies in humans have reported contradictory findings with both higher and lower PIC contributions to motoneuron self-sustained firing. In this longitudinal (∼17 weeks) study we tracked changes in PIC contribution to motoneuron self-sustained firing, using the ΔF calculation (i.e. onset-offset hysteresis of motor unit pairs), in tibialis anterior muscles with normal strength and with clinical signs of weakness in people with ALS. ΔFs decreased over time in muscles with clinical signs of weakness. The PIC contribution to motoneuron self-sustained firing increases before the onset of muscle weakness, and subsequently decreases when muscle weakness progresses.",2023
37752346,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, causing progressive muscle weakness and respiratory failure. The presence of an expanded hexanucleotide repeat in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) is the most frequent mutation causing familial ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). To determine if suppressing expression of C9ORF72 gene products can reduce toxicity, we designed a set of artificial microRNAs (amiRNA) targeting the human C9ORF72 gene. Here we report that an AAV9-mediated amiRNA significantly suppresses expression of the C9ORF72 mRNA, protein, and toxic dipeptide repeat proteins generated by the expanded repeat in the brain and spinal cord of C9ORF72 transgenic mice.",2023
37566027,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease affecting the upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, motor impairments, disabilities and death. Approximately 5-10% of ALS cases are associated with positive family history (familial ALS or fALS), whilst the remainder are sporadic (sporadic ALS, sALS). At least 50 genes have been identified as causative or risk factors for ALS. Established pathogenic variants include superoxide dismutase type 1 (<i>SOD1</i>), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (<i>c9orf72</i>), TAR DNA Binding Protein (<i>TARDBP</i>), and Fused In Sarcoma (<i>FUS</i>); additional ALS-related genes including Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 2B (<i>CHMP2B</i>), Senataxin (<i>SETX</i>), Sequestosome 1 (<i>SQSTM1</i>), TANK Binding Kinase 1 (<i>TBK1</i>) and NIMA Related Kinase 1 (<i>NEK1</i>), have been identified. Mutations in these genes could impair different mechanisms, including vesicle transport, autophagy, and cytoskeletal or mitochondrial functions. So far, there is no effective therapy against ALS. Thus, early diagnosis and disease risk predictions remain one of the best options against ALS symptomologies. Proteomic biomarkers, microRNAs, and extracellular vehicles (EVs) serve as promising tools for disease diagnosis or progression assessment. These markers are relatively easy to obtain from blood or cerebrospinal fluids and can be used to identify potential genetic causative and risk factors even in the preclinical stage before symptoms appear. In addition, antisense oligonucleotides and RNA gene therapies have successfully been employed against other diseases, such as childhood-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which could also give hope to ALS patients. Therefore, an effective gene and biomarker panel should be generated for potentially ""at risk"" individuals to provide timely interventions and better treatment outcomes for ALS patients as soon as possible.",2023
37565261,"The wobbler mouse is a widely used model system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and exhibits progressive neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in association with skeletal muscle wasting. This study has used wobbler brain preparations for the systematic and mass spectrometric determination of proteome-wide changes. The proteomic characterization of total protein extracts from wobbler specimens was carried out with the help of an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and revealed elevated levels of glia cell marker proteins, i.e., glial fibrillary acidic protein and the actin-binding protein coronin. In contrast, the abundance of the actin-binding protein neurabin and the scaffolding protein named piccolo of the presynaptic cytomatrix were shown to be reduced. The increased abundance of glial fibrillary acidic protein, which is frequently used in neuropathological studies as a marker protein of glial scar formation, was confirmed by immunoblotting. In analogy, the proteomic profiling of the brain from another established murine model of motor neuron disease, the SOD1mouse, also showed increased levels of this intermediate filament protein. This suggests that neurodegenerative processes are associated with astrogliosis in both the wobbler and SOD1 brain.",2023
37185741,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons in the spinal cord, cerebral cortex, and medulla oblongata. Most patients present a clinical phenotype of classic ALS-with predominant atrophy, muscle weakness, and fasciculations-and survival of 3 to 5 years following diagnosis. In the present review, we performed a literature search to provide an update on the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in ALS. There are two types of ALS: the familial form with genetic involvement, and the sporadic form with a multifactorial origin. ALS pathophysiology is characterized by involvement of multiple processes, including oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. Moreover, it is proposed that conditioning risk factors affect ALS development, such as susceptibility to neurodegeneration in motor neurons, the intensity of performed physical activity, and intestinal dysbiosis with involvement of the enteric nervous system, which supports the existing theories of disease generation. To improve patients' prognosis and survival, it is necessary to further deepen our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of ALS.",2023
37133535,"Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a motor neuron disease characterised by loss of the upper motor neurons. Most patients present with slowly progressive spasticity of the legs, which may also spread to the arms or bulbar regions. It is challenging to distinguish between PLS, early-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). The current diagnostic criteria advise against extensive genetic testing. This recommendation is, however, based on limited data.",2023
37116688,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease whose aetiology is unknown. It is characterised by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Approximately 90% of cases of ALS are sporadic, whereas the other 10% are familial. Regardless of whether the case is familial o sporadic, patients will develop progressive weakness, muscle atrophy with spasticity, and muscle contractures. Life expectancy of these patients is generally 2 to 5 years after diagnosis.",2023
37020097,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons that leads to muscle weakness, paralysis, and death, but the effects of disease-causing mutations on axonal outgrowth of neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (hiPSC-MN) are poorly understood. The use of hiPSC-MN is a promising tool to develop more relevant models for target identification and drug development in ALS research, but questions remain concerning the effects of distinct disease-causing mutations on axon regeneration. Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were the first to be discovered in ALS patients. Here, we investigated the effect of the SOD1<sup>A4V</sup> mutation on axonal regeneration of hiPSC-MNs, utilizing compartmentalized microfluidic devices, which are powerful tools for studying hiPSC-MN distal axons. Surprisingly, SOD1<sup>+/A4V</sup> hiPSC-MNs regenerated axons more quickly following axotomy than those expressing the native form of SOD1. Though initial axon regrowth was not significantly different following axotomy, enhanced regeneration was apparent at later time points, indicating an increased rate of outgrowth. This regeneration model could be used to identify factors that enhance the rate of human axon regeneration.",2023
36951214,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by a progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons leading to muscle weakness and eventually death. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) presents clinically with significant behavioural decline. Approximately 10% of cases have a known family history, and disease-linked mutations in multiple genes have been identified in FTD and ALS. More recently, ALS and FTD-linked variants have been identified in the CCNF gene, which accounts for an estimated 0.6% to over 3% of familial ALS cases.",2023
36799225,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating motoneuron disease, in which lower motoneurons lose control of skeletal muscles. Degeneration of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) occurs at the initial stage of ALS. Dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) from G4C2 repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation are known to cause C9orf72-associated ALS (C9-ALS). However, DPR inclusion burdens are weakly correlated with neurodegenerative areas in C9-ALS patients, indicating that DPRs may exert cell non-autonomous effects, in addition to the known intracellular pathological mechanisms. Here, we report that poly-GA, the most abundant form of DPR in C9-ALS, is released from cells. Local administration of poly-GA proteins in peripheral synaptic regions causes muscle weakness and impaired neuromuscular transmission <i>in vivo</i>. The NMJ structure cannot be maintained, as evidenced by the fragmentation of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters and distortion of presynaptic nerve terminals. Mechanistic study demonstrated that extracellular poly-GA sequesters soluble Agrin ligands and inhibits Agrin-MuSK signaling. Our findings provide a novel cell non-autonomous mechanism by which poly-GA impairs NMJs in C9-ALS. Thus, targeting NMJs could be an early therapeutic intervention for C9-ALS.",2023
36793789,"Superoxide dismutase-1 is a ubiquitously expressed antioxidant enzyme. Mutations in <i>SOD1</i> can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, probably via a toxic gain-of-function involving protein aggregation and prion-like mechanisms. Recently, homozygosity for loss-of-function mutations in <i>SOD1</i> has been reported in patients presenting with infantile-onset motor neuron disease. We explored the bodily effects of superoxide dismutase-1 enzymatic deficiency in eight children homozygous for the p.C112Wfs*11 truncating mutation. In addition to physical and imaging examinations, we collected blood, urine and skin fibroblast samples. We used a comprehensive panel of clinically established analyses to assess organ function and analysed oxidative stress markers, antioxidant compounds, and the characteristics of the mutant Superoxide dismutase-1. From around 8 months of age, all patients exhibited progressive signs of both upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, cerebellar, brain stem, and frontal lobe atrophy and elevated plasma neurofilament concentration indicating ongoing axonal damage. The disease progression seemed to slow down over the following years. The p.C112Wfs*11 gene product is unstable, rapidly degraded and no aggregates were found in fibroblast. Most laboratory tests indicated normal organ integrity and only a few modest deviations were found. The patients displayed anaemia with shortened survival of erythrocytes containing decreased levels of reduced glutathione. A variety of other antioxidants and oxidant damage markers were within normal range. In conclusion, non-neuronal organs in humans show a remarkable tolerance to absence of Superoxide dismutase-1 enzymatic activity. The study highlights the enigmatic specific vulnerability of the motor system to both gain-of-function mutations in <i>SOD1</i> and loss of the enzyme as in the here depicted infantile superoxide dismutase-1 deficiency syndrome.",2023

36444378,"The symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) include muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. These symptoms result from denervation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor neuron cell death in the brain and spinal cord. Due to the ""dying back"" pattern of motor neuron degeneration, protecting NMJs should be a therapeutic priority. Although exercise has the potential to protect against NMJ denervation, its use in ALS has been controversial. Most preclinical studies have focused on aerobic exercise, which report that exercise can be beneficial at moderate intensities. The effects of resistance exercise on NMJ preservation in limb muscles have not been explored.",2022
35439439,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron degeneration that causes neuromuscular denervation, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. Work over the decades using ALS mouse models has revealed that while initial pathology may occur within motor neurons, disease pathology is cell non-autologous. Impairment of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) occurs before motor neuron frank degeneration; however, precisely when the early pathogenesis of the neurovascular units occurs is not fully understood. Here we examine changes in morphology of neurovascular units, associated gene and protein expression in the lumbar spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, and wild-type mice and correlate results with previous reports of early pathological events. Using RNA-sequencing and immunolabeling, we also show that both the neurovascular units and the vasculature of the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> lumbar spinal cord present important modifications throughout the disease. Genes relevant for the neurovascular unit and immune cells were differentially expressed in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> ventral lumbar spinal cord compared to wild-type. A reduction in capillary density and tight junction (TJ) with overt BSCB breakdown was observed in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> lumbar spinal cord and ultrastructural observation revealed intact TJ. Additionally, thickened basement membrane, increased pericytes, and string vessels were observed. These alterations in neurovascular units and the vasculature are observed prior to reports of initial neuromuscular junction denervation. The identification of early pathogenesis may be critical to develop diagnostic tests and development of novel treatment strategies that target these early events.",2022
35302338,"Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of acquired or hereditary conditions that affect striated muscle function. The resulting decrease in muscle strength and motility irreversibly impacts quality of life. In addition to directly affecting skeletal muscle, pathogenesis can also arise from dysfunctional crosstalk between nerves and muscles, and may include cardiac impairment. Muscular weakness is often progressive and paralleled by continuous decline in the ability of skeletal muscle to functionally adapt and regenerate. Normally, the skeletal muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells, ensure tissue homeostasis by providing myoblasts for growth, maintenance, repair and regeneration. We recently defined 'Satellite Cell-opathies' as those inherited neuromuscular conditions presenting satellite cell dysfunction in muscular dystrophies and myopathies (doi:10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112906). Here, we expand the portfolio of Satellite Cell-opathies by evaluating the potential impairment of satellite cell function across all 16 categories of neuromuscular disorders, including those with mainly neurogenic and cardiac involvement. We explore the expression dynamics of myopathogenes, genes whose mutation leads to skeletal muscle pathogenesis, using transcriptomic analysis. This revealed that 45% of myopathogenes are differentially expressed during early satellite cell activation (0 - 5 hours). Of these 271 myopathogenes, 83 respond to Pax7, a master regulator of satellite cells. Our analysis suggests possible perturbation of satellite cell function in many neuromuscular disorders across all categories, including those where skeletal muscle pathology is not predominant. This characterisation further aids understanding of pathomechanisms and informs on development of prognostic and diagnostic tools, and ultimately, new therapeutics.",2022
35163674,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that shows progressive muscle weakness. A few treatments exist including symptomatic therapies, which can prolong survival or reduce a symptom; however, no fundamental therapies have been found. As a therapeutic strategy, enhancing muscle force is important for patients' quality of life. In this study, we focused on skeletal muscle-specific myosin regulatory light chain kinase (skMLCK), which potentially enhances muscle contraction, as overexpression of skMLCK was thought to improve muscle function. The adeno-associated virus serotype 6 encoding skMLCK (AAV6/skMLCK) and eGFP (control) was produced and injected intramuscularly into the lower limbs of SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice, which are a familial ALS model. AAV6/skMLCK showed the successful expression of skMLCK in the muscle tissues. Although the control did not affect the muscle force in both of the WT and SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice, AAV6/skMLCK enhanced the twitch force of SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice and the tetanic force of WT and SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice. These results indicate that overexpression of skMLCK can enhance the tetanic force of healthy muscle as well as rescue weakened muscle function. In conclusion, the gene transfer of skMLCK has the potential to be a new therapy for ALS as well as for other neuromuscular diseases.",2022
35080077,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal and incurable neurodegenerative disease due to the loss of upper and lower motor neurons, which leads to muscle weakness, atrophy, and paralysis. Sigma-1 receptor (σ-1R) is a ligand-operated protein that exhibits pro-survival and anti-apoptotic properties. In addition, mutations in its codifying gene are linked to development of juvenile ALS pointing to an important role in ALS. Here, we investigated the disease-modifying effects of pridopidine, a σ-1R agonist, using a delayed onset SOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS. Mice were administered a continuous release of pridopidine (3.0 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks starting before the appearance of any sign of muscle weakness. Mice were monitored weekly and several behavioural tests were used to evaluate muscle strength, motor coordination and gait patterns. Pridopidine-treated SOD1 G93A mice showed genotype-specific effects with the prevention of cachexia. In addition, these effects exhibited significant improvement of motor behaviour 5 weeks after treatment ended. However, the survival of the animals was not extended. In summary, these results show that pridopidine can modify the disease phenotype of ALS-associated cachexia and motor deficits in a SOD1 G93A mouse model.",2022
34984651,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease where muscle weakness and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation precede motor neuron cell death. Although acetylcholine is the canonical neurotransmitter at the mammalian NMJ synapse, glutamate has recently been identified as a critical neurotransmitter for NMJ development and maintenance. One source of glutamate is through the catabolism of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), which is found in mM concentrations in mammalian motoneurons, where it is released upon stimulation and hydrolyzed to glutamate by the glial enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII). Using the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> model of ALS, we found an almost fourfold elevation of GCPII enzymatic activity in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> versus WT muscle and a robust increase in GCPII expression which was specifically associated with activated macrophages infiltrating the muscle. 2-(Phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (2PMPA) is a potent GCPII inhibitor which robustly blocks glutamate release from NAAG but is highly polar with limited tissue penetration. To improve this, we covalently attached 2PMPA to a hydroxyl polyamidoamine (PAMAM-G4-OH) dendrimer delivery system (D-2PMPA) which is known to target activated macrophages in affected tissues. Systemic D-2PMPA therapy (20 mg/kg 2PMPA equivalent; IP 2 × /week) was found to localize in muscle macrophages in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice and completely normalize the enhanced GCPII activity. Although no changes in body weight or survival were observed, D-2PMPA significantly improved grip strength and inhibited the loss of NMJ innervation in the gastrocnemius muscles. Our finding that inhibiting elevated GCPII activity in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> muscle can prolong muscle function and delay NMJ denervation may have early therapeutic implications for ALS patients.",2022
34880312,"Degeneration of brainstem serotonin neurons has been demonstrated in ALS patients and mouse models and was found responsible for the development of spasticity. Consistent with involvement of central serotonin pathways, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2B</sub>R) was upregulated in microglia of ALS mice. Its deletion worsened disease outcome in the Sod1<sup>G86R</sup> mouse model and led to microglial degeneration. In ALS patients, a polymorphism in HTR2B gene leading to higher receptor expression in CNS, was associated with increased survival in patients as well as prevention of microglial degeneration. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the effect of a 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>R agonist : BW723C86 (BW), in the Sod1<sup>G86R</sup> mouse model. Despite good pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, BW did not ameliorate disease outcome or motor neuron degeneration in a fast progressing mouse model of ALS despite evidence of modulation of microglial gene expression.",2021
34879411,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset motor neuron disorder which is characterized by progressive motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and spasticity. In Germany, 6000-8000 people are affected by ALS. Between 1200 and 1600 newly diagnosed patients are expected each year. Protein deposits in the cytoplasm of motor neurons are a molecular feature of ALS. The most common protein aggregates result from excessive deposition of TDP-43. Familial ALS is present in 5 to 10 % of all ALS patients. Common causal genes include C9orf72, SOD1, FUS, and TARDBP. Genetic factors may be involved even without a family history of ALS and may be underestimated. The disease course and progression are highly variable. Symptom severity and rate of progression are determined by the ALS Functional Scale (ALSFRS-R). Beyond clinical symptoms and the patient's perception of disease burden, measurement of slow vital capacity (SVC), peak cough flow (PCF), and body mass index (BMI) are used to underscore the indications for ventilatory and nutritional interventions, as well as palliative care. The validity of the biomarker neurofilament light chain (NF-L) for estimating prognosis is currently being investigated. ALS is not curable - however, various individual treatment options have to be considered for improving survival, symptom control and social participation. The care in specialized ALS centers is recommended to ensure optimal treatment regarding symptomatic medication, assistive devices, nutrition support and ventilation therapy. Optimal care is achieved by interdisciplinary collaboration of general practitioners, specialized physicians, neurologists and ALS experts being integrated in multiprofessional care networks.",2021
34788402,"Pathogenic variants in SOD1, encoding superoxide dismutase 1, are responsible for about 20% of all familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, through a gain-of-function mechanism. Recently, two reports showed that a specific homozygous SOD1 loss-of-function variant is associated with an infantile progressive motor-neurological syndrome. Exome sequencing followed by molecular studies, including cDNA analysis, SOD1 protein levels and enzymatic activity, and plasma neurofilament light chain levels, were undertaken in an infant with severe global developmental delay, axial hypotonia and limb spasticity. We identified a homozygous 3-bp in-frame deletion in SOD1. cDNA analysis predicted the loss of a single valine residue from a tandem pair (p.Val119/Val120) in the wild-type protein, yet expression levels and splicing were preserved. Analysis of SOD1 activity and protein levels in erythrocyte lysates showed essentially no enzymatic activity and undetectable SOD1 protein in the child, whereas the parents had ∼50% protein expression and activity relative to controls. Neurofilament light chain levels in plasma were elevated, implying ongoing axonal injury and neurodegeneration. Thus, we provide confirmatory evidence of a second biallelic variant in an infant with a severe neurological syndrome and suggest that the in-frame deletion causes instability and subsequent degeneration of SOD1. We highlight the importance of the valine residues at positions V119-120, and suggest possible implications for future therapeutics research.",2022
34103575,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Skeletal muscle is a prime source for biomarker discovery since it is one of the earliest sites to manifest disease pathology. From a prior RNA sequencing project, we identified FGF23 as a potential muscle biomarker in ALS. Here, we validate this finding with a large collection of ALS muscle samples and found a 13-fold increase over normal controls. FGF23 was also increased in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse, beginning at a very early stage and well before the onset of clinical symptoms. FGF23 levels progressively increased through end-stage in the mouse. Immunohistochemistry of ALS muscle showed prominent FGF23 immunoreactivity in the endomysial connective tissue and along the muscle membrane and was significantly higher around grouped atrophic fibers compared to non-atrophic fibers. ELISA of plasma samples from the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse showed an increase in FGF23 at end-stage whereas no increase was detected in a large cohort of ALS patients. In conclusion, FGF23 is a novel muscle biomarker in ALS and joins a molecular signature that emerges in very early preclinical stages. The early appearance of FGF23 and its progressive increase with disease progression offers a new direction for exploring the molecular basis and response to the underlying pathology of ALS.",2021
33950665,"Neuromuscular diseases result in muscle weakness, disability, and, in many instances, death. Preclinical models form the bedrock of research into these disorders, and the development of <i>in vivo</i> and potentially translational biomarkers for the accurate identification of disease is crucial. Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy can provide a rapid, label-free, and highly specific molecular fingerprint of tissue, making it an attractive potential biomarker. In this study, we have developed and tested an <i>in vivo</i> intramuscular fiber optic Raman technique in two mouse models of devastating human neuromuscular diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and <i>mdx</i>, respectively). The method identified diseased and healthy muscle with high classification accuracies (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC): 0.76-0.92). In addition, changes in diseased muscle over time were also identified (AUROCs 0.89-0.97). Key spectral changes related to proteins and the loss of α-helix protein structure. Importantly, <i>in vivo</i> recording did not cause functional motor impairment and only a limited, resolving tissue injury was seen on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Lastly, we demonstrate that <i>ex vivo</i> muscle from human patients with these conditions produced similar spectra to those observed in mice. We conclude that spontaneous Raman spectroscopy of muscle shows promise as a translational research tool.",2021
33894192,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is considered to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. The causal cascade is, however, not known.

33556455,"In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), large motoneurons degenerate first, causing muscle weakness. Transgenic mouse models with a mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) revealed that motoneurons innervating the fast-fatigable muscular fibres disconnect very early. The cause of this peripheric disconnection has not yet been established. Early pathological signs were described in motoneurons during the postnatal period of SOD1 transgenic mice. Here, we investigated whether the early changes of electrical and morphological properties previously reported in the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> strain also occur in the SOD1<sup>G93A-low</sup> expressor line with particular attention to the different subsets of motoneurons defined by their discharge firing pattern (transient, sustained, or delayed-onset firing). Intracellular staining and recording were performed in lumbar motoneurons from entire brainstem-spinal cord preparations of SOD1<sup>G93A-low</sup> transgenic mice and their WT littermates during the second postnatal week. Our results show that SOD1<sup>G93A-low</sup> motoneurons exhibit a dendritic overbranching similar to that described previously in the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> strain at the same age. Further we found an hypoexcitability in the delayed-onset firing SOD1<sup>G93A-low</sup> motoneurons (lower gain and higher voltage threshold). We conclude that dendritic overbranching and early hypoexcitability are common features of both low expressor SOD1 mutants (G85R and G93A-low). In the high-expressor SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> line, we found hyperexcitability in the sustained firing motoneurons at the same period, suggesting a delay in compensatory mechanisms. Overall, our results suggest that the hypoexcitability indicate an early dysfunction of the delayed-onset motoneurons and could account as early pathological signs of the disease.",2021
33498186,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, causing degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). ALS patients suffer from hyperreflexia, spasticity, paralysis and muscle atrophy and typically die due to respiratory failure 1-5 years after disease onset. In addition to the degeneration of motor neurons on the cellular level, ALS has been associated with neuroinflammation, such as microgliosis. Microglial activation in ALS can either be protective or degenerative to the neurons. Among others, mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9Orf72), transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP) 43 and vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 54 (VPS54) genes have been associated with ALS. Here, we describe the dual role and functionality of microglia in four different in vivo ALS models and search for the lowest common denominator with respect to the role of microglia in the highly heterogeneous disease of ALS.",2021
33409820,"Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is classically considered a 'pure' upper motor neuron disorder. Motor cortex atrophy and pyramidal tract degeneration are thought to be pathognomonic of PLS, but extra-motor cerebral changes are poorly characterized. In a prospective neuroimaging study, forty PLS patients were systematically evaluated with a standardised imaging, genetic and clinical protocol. Patients were screened for ALS and HSP associated mutations, as well as C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeats. Clinical assessment included composite reflex scores, spasticity scales, functional rating scales, and screening for cognitive and behavioural deficits. The neuroimaging protocol evaluated cortical atrophy patterns, subcortical grey matter changes and white matter alterations in whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses. PLS patients tested negative for known ALS- and HSP-associated mutations and C9orf72 repeat expansions. Voxel-wise analyses revealed anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, insular, opercular, orbitofrontal and bilateral mesial temporal grey matter changes and white matter alterations in the fornix, brainstem, temporal lobes, and cerebellum. Significant thalamus, caudate, hippocampus, putamen and accumbens nucleus volume reductions were also identified. Extra-motor clinical manifestations were dominated by verbal fluency deficits, language deficits, apathy and pseudobulbar affect. Our clinical and radiological evaluation confirms considerable extra-motor changes in a population-based cohort of PLS patients. Our data suggest that PLS should no longer be considered a neurodegenerative disorder selectively affecting the pyramidal system. PLS is associated with widespread extra-motor changes and manifestations which should be carefully considered in the multidisciplinary management of this low-incidence condition.",2021
33359475,"The pathophysiology of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a disease caused by the gradual degeneration of motoneurons, is still largely unknown. Insufficient neurotrophic support has been cited as one of the causes of motoneuron cell death. Neurotrophic factors such as BDNF have been evaluated in ALS human clinical trials, but yielded disappointing results attributed to the poor pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BDNF. In the inherited ALS G93A SOD1 animal model, deletion of the BDNF receptor TrkB.T1 delays spinal cord motoneuron cell death and muscle weakness through an unknown cellular mechanism. Here we show that TrkB.T1 is expressed ubiquitously in the spinal cord and its deletion does not change the SOD1 mutant spinal cord inflammatory state suggesting that TrkB.T1 does not influence microglia or astrocyte activation. Although TrkB.T1 knockout in astrocytes preserves muscle strength and co-ordination at early stages of disease, its specific conditional deletion in motoneurons or astrocytes does not delay motoneuron cell death during the early stage of the disease. These data suggest that TrkB.T1 may limit the neuroprotective BDNF signaling to motoneurons via a non-cell autonomous mechanism providing new understanding into the reasons for past clinical failures and insights into the design of future clinical trials employing TrkB agonists in ALS.",2021
33359139,"Disruption in copper homeostasis causes a number of cognitive and motor deficits. Wilson's disease and Menkes disease are neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from mutations in the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B, with ATP7A mutations also causing occipital horn syndrome, and distal motor neuropathy. A 65 year old male presenting with brachial amyotrophic diplegia and diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was found to harbor a p.Met1311Val (M1311V) substitution variant in ATP7A. ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive muscle weakness, synaptic deficits and degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. To investigate the potential contribution of the ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> variant to neurodegeneration, we obtained and characterized both patient-derived fibroblasts and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into motor neurons (iPSC-MNs), and compared them to control cell lines. We found reduced localization of ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) at basal copper levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-MNs. In addition, redistribution of ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> out of the TGN in response to increased extracellular copper was defective in patient fibroblasts. This manifested in enhanced intracellular copper accumulation and reduced survival of ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> fibroblasts. iPSC-MNs harboring the ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> variant showed decreased dendritic complexity, aberrant spontaneous firing, and decreased survival. Finally, expression of the ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> variant in Drosophila motor neurons resulted in motor deficits. Apilimod, a drug that targets vesicular transport and recently shown to enhance survival of C9orf72-ALS/FTD iPSC-MNs, also increased survival of ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> iPSC-MNs and reduced motor deficits in Drosophila expressing ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup>. Taken together, these observations suggest that ATP7A<sup>M1311V</sup> negatively impacts its role as a copper transporter and impairs several aspects of motor neuron function and morphology.",2021
33309802,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) arises from the combined degeneration of motor neurons (MN) and corticospinal neurons (CSN). Recent clinical and pathological studies suggest that ALS might start in the motor cortex and spread along the corticofugal axonal projections (including the CSN), either via altered cortical excitability and activity or via prion-like propagation of misfolded proteins. Using mouse genetics, we recently provided the first experimental arguments in favour of the corticofugal hypothesis, but the mechanism of propagation remained an open question. To gain insight into this matter, we tested here the possibility that the toxicity of the corticofugal projection neurons (CFuPN) to their targets could be mediated by their cell autonomous-expression of an ALS causing transgene and possible diffusion of toxic misfolded proteins to their spinal targets. We generated a Crym-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse line to ablate the SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> transgene selectively in CFuPN. This was sufficient to fully rescue the CSN and to limit spasticity, but had no effect on the burden of misfolded SOD1 protein in the spinal cord, MN survival, disease onset and progression. The data thus indicate that in ALS corticofugal propagation is likely not mediated by prion-like mechanisms, but could possibly rather rely on cortical hyperexcitability.",2021
33155358,"Autosomal-recessive mutations in the Alsin Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ALS2) gene may cause specific subtypes of childhood-onset progressive neurodegenerative motor neuron diseases (MND). These diseases can manifest with a clinical continuum from infantile ascending hereditary spastic paraplegia (IAHSP) to juvenile-onset forms with or without lower motor neuron involvement, the juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) and the juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS). We report 11 patients from seven unrelated Turkish and Yemeni families with clinical signs of IAHSP or JPLS. We performed haplotype analysis or next-generation panel sequencing followed by Sanger Sequencing to unravel the genetic disease cause. We described their clinical phenotype and analyzed the pathogenicity of the detected variants with bioinformatics tools. We further reviewed all previously reported cases with ALS2-related MND. We identified five novel homozygous pathogenic variants in ALS2 at various positions: c.275_276delAT (p.Tyr92CysfsTer11), c.1044C>G (p.Tyr348Ter), c.1718C>A (p.Ala573Glu), c.3161T>C (p.Leu1054Pro), and c.1471+1G>A (NM_020919.3, NP_065970.2). In our cohort, disease onset was in infancy or early childhood with rapid onset of motor neuron signs. Muscle weakness, spasticity, severe dysarthria, dysphagia, and facial weakness were common features in the first decade of life. Frameshift and nonsense mutations clustered in the N-terminal Alsin domains are most prevalent. We enriched the mutational spectrum of ALS2-related disorders with five novel pathogenic variants. Our study indicates a high detection rate of ALS2 mutations in patients with a clinically well-characterized early onset MND. Intrafamilial and even interfamilial diversity in patients with identical pathogenic variants suggest yet unknown modifiers for phenotypic expression.",2021
33087694,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by progressive loss of motor neurons (MNs) and subsequent muscle weakness. These pathological features are associated with numerous cellular changes, including alteration in mitochondrial morphology and function. However, the molecular mechanisms associating mitochondrial structure with ALS pathology are poorly understood. In this study, we found that Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) was dephosphorylated in several ALS models, including those with SOD1 and TDP-43 mutations, and the dephosphorylation was mediated by the pathological induction of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity in these models. Suppression of the PP1-Drp1 cascade effectively prevented ALS-related symptoms, including mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial complex I impairment, axonal degeneration, and cell death, in primary neuronal culture models, iPSC-derived human MNs, and zebrafish models in vivo. These results suggest that modulation of PP1-Drp1 activity may be a therapeutic target for multiple pathological features of ALS.",2020
33071739,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes degeneration of the lower and upper motor neurons and is the most prevalent motor neuron disease. This disease is characterized by muscle weakness, stiffness, and hyperreflexia. Patients survive for a short period from the onset of the disease. Most cases are sporadic, with only 10% of the cases being genetic. Many genes are now known to be involved in familial ALS cases, including some of the sporadic cases. It has also been observed that, in addition to genetic factors, there are numerous molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies, such as excitotoxicity, mitochondrial disorders, alterations in axonal transport, oxidative stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and neuroinflammation. This pathology affects the motor neurons, the spinal cord, the cerebellum, and the brain, but recently, it has been shown that it also affects the visual system. This impact occurs not only at the level of the oculomotor system but also at the retinal level, which is why the retina is being proposed as a possible biomarker of this pathology. The current review discusses the main aspects mentioned above related to ALS, such as the main genes involved, the most important molecular mechanisms that affect this pathology, its ocular involvement, and the possible usefulness of the retina as a biomarker.",2020

32827689,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset disease characterized by the progressive death of motoneurons and denervation of muscle fibers. To restore motor function, surviving motoneurons in partially denervated muscles typically sprout axons to reinnervate denervated endplates. However, studies on the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> rodent models of ALS indicate that sprouting is significantly limited in fast, but not slow, twitch muscles after disease onset. This limitation hastens the rate of muscle weakness and loss of motor function. The causes of this limitation are currently unknown. Sprouting could be limited because the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mutation weakens motoneurons making them incapable of expanding their field of innervation. Alternatively, motoneurons may be capable of sprouting, but unable to do so due to the loss of a permissive sprouting environment. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we compared the sprouting capacity of motoneuron subtypes by partially denervating the fast twitch plantaris (composed of type IIa/IIb muscle fibers) and slow twitch soleus muscles (type I/IIa fibers) prior to disease onset and weakening in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and WT mice. We found that only motoneurons innervating the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> plantaris had a limited sprouting capacity. This was correlated with the selective loss of terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) at IIb fibers and an increase in macrophage infiltration. Treating SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, masitinib, significantly reduced infiltration, prevented TSC loss, and increased the sprouting capacity to near normal. These results suggest that TSCs at denervated type IIb muscle fibers are aberrantly targeted by infiltrating macrophages in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, and their loss accounts, at least in part, for the compromised sprouting capacity of the largest motoneurons during early stages of ALS.",2020
32671738,"Motor neuron diseases (MND) are a group of fatal progressive neurodegenerative diseases, which selectively affect the motor system in the anterior horn of spinal cord, brainstem, cortex and pyramidal tract. Motor neurons could be divided into two groups, which are upper groups in the motor cortex and lower groups in the brain stem and spinal cord. Loss of lower motor neurons leads to muscle weakness, wasting and cramps. Loss of upper motor neurons leads to brisk reflexes and functional limits. There are several types of motor neuron disease: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Now, the studies of autophagy in MND focus on the type of ALS, so this chapter will summarize the alteration of autophagy in motor neurons, and how that knowledge contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of ALS.",2020

32526057,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily the motor system, but in which extra-motor manifestations are increasingly recognized. The loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex, the brain stem nuclei and the anterior horn of the spinal cord gives rise to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. ALS often has a focal onset but subsequently spreads to different body regions, where failure of respiratory muscles typically limits survival to 2-5 years after disease onset. In up to 50% of cases, there are extra-motor manifestations such as changes in behaviour, executive dysfunction and language problems. In 10%-15% of patients, these problems are severe enough to meet the clinical criteria of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In 10% of ALS patients, the family history suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The remaining 90% have no affected family members and are classified as sporadic ALS. The causes of ALS appear to be heterogeneous and are only partially understood. To date, more than 20 genes have been associated with ALS. The most common genetic cause is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, responsible for 30%-50% of familial ALS and 7% of sporadic ALS. These expansions are also a frequent cause of frontotemporal dementia, emphasizing the molecular overlap between ALS and FTD. To this day there is no cure or effective treatment for ALS and the cornerstone of treatment remains multidisciplinary care, including nutritional and respiratory support and symptom management. In this review, different aspects of ALS are discussed, including epidemiology, aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, differential diagnosis, investigations, treatment and future prospects.",2020

Neuropathological examination revealed a loss of lower motor neurons and degeneration of Clarke's column commensurate with that of the posterior spinocerebellar tract and the middle root zone of the posterior column. The primary motor area was minimally affected. Characteristic SOD1-immunopositive neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions, mixed with neurofilament accumulation, were present in the affected areas. Isolated inferior olivary hypertrophy was observed, but did not involve the contralateral dentate nucleus, or the ipsilateral red nucleus and central tegmental tract, where no neuronal inclusions were found.

31376190,"Muscle weakness plays an important role in neuromuscular disorders comprising amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it is not established whether muscle denervation originates from the motor neurons, the muscles or more likely both. Previous studies have shown that the expression of the SOD1G93A mutation in skeletal muscles causes denervation of the neuromuscular junctions, inability to regenerate and consequent atrophy, all clear symptoms of ALS. In this work, we used SOD1G93A mice, a model that best mimics some pathological features of both familial and sporadic ALS, and we investigated some biological effects induced by the activation of the P2X7 receptor in the skeletal muscles. The P2X7, belonging to the ionotropic family of purinergic receptors for extracellular ATP, is abundantly expressed in the healthy skeletal muscles, where it controls cell duplication, differentiation, regeneration or death. In particular, we evaluated whether an in vivo treatment in SOD1G93A mice with the P2X7 specific agonist 2'(3')-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine5'-triphosphate (BzATP) just before the onset of a pathological neuromuscular phenotype could exert beneficial effects in the skeletal muscles. Our findings indicate that stimulation of P2X7 improves the innervation and metabolism of myofibers, moreover elicits the proliferation/differentiation of satellite cells, thus preventing the denervation atrophy of skeletal muscles in SOD1G93A mice. Overall, this study suggests that a P2X7-targeted and site-specific modulation might be a strategy to interfere with the complex multifactorial and multisystem nature of ALS.",2020
31257275,"Objective Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons that progresses to paralysis of almost all skeletal muscles of the extremities, bulbar, and respiratory system. Although most ALS cases are sporadic, about 10% are dominantly inherited. We herein report an atypical phenotype of familial ALS (fALS). To elucidate the phenotype-genotype correlation of this atypical phenotype of fALS, clinical and genetic investigations were performed. Methods and Patients Five sibling patients (three men, two women) from a Japanese family and one healthy sibling (a woman) were clinically interviewed and examined. Genetic analyses, including genome-wide linkage analyses and whole-exome sequencing, were performed using genomic DNA extracted from the peripheral blood samples of these siblings. Results The clinical features of fALS are characterized by slow progression (mean duration of the disease±standard deviation [SD]: 19.6±3.9 years) and lower extremities-predominant late-onset muscular weakness (mean onset of muscular weakness±SD: 52.8±2.6 years). Genetic analyses revealed novel heterozygous missense mutations of c.2668C>T, p.R890C in the PLEC gene and c.421G>C, p.V141L in the ST3GAL6 gene in all affected siblings. Conclusion A new atypical fALS family with a benign clinical course is herein reported. We identified two candidate gene mutations of PLEC and ST3GAL6 linked to this phenotype.",2019
31189468,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease resulting from motor neuron degeneration that causes muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually respiratory failure. We investigated whether recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding human hepatocyte growth factor (rAAV-HGF) could generate beneficial effects in two mouse models with neuromuscular problems when intrathecally delivered to the subarachnoid space. We chose AAV serotype 1 (rAAV1) based on the expression levels and distribution of HGF protein in the lumbar spinal cord (LSC). After a single intrathecal (IT) injection of rAAV1-HGF, the protein level of HGF in the LSC peaked on day 14 and thereafter gradually decreased over the next 14 weeks. rAAV1-HGF was initially tested in the mouse nerve crush model. IT injection of rAAV1-HGF improved mouse hindlimb strength and rotarod performance, while histological analyses showed that the length of regenerated axons was increased and the structure of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) was restored. rAAV1-HGF was also evaluated in the SOD1-G93A transgenic (TG) mouse model. Again, rAAV1-HGF not only improved motor performance but also increased the survival rate. Moreover, the number and diameter of spinal motor neurons (SMNs) were increased, and the shape of the NMJs restored. Data from in vitro motor cortical culture experiments indicated that treatment with recombinant HGF protein (rHGF) increased the axon length of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMNs). When cultures were treated with an ERK inhibitor, the effects of HGF on axon elongation, protein aggregation, and oxidative stress were suppressed, indicating that ERK phosphorylation played an important role(s). Taken together, our results suggested that HGF might play an important role(s) in delaying disease progression in the SOD1-G93A TG mouse model by reducing oxidative stress through the control of ERK phosphorylation.",2019

Therefore, initial symptoms that include fasciculation, spasticity, muscle atrophy, and weakness emerge following axons retraction and consequent muscles' denervation. Patients lose the ability to talk and swallow and rely on parenteral nutrition and assisted ventilation to survive. The degeneration caused by ALS is progressive and irreversible. In addition to the autonomous mechanism of neuronal cell death, non-autonomous mechanisms have been proved to be toxic for motor neurons, such as the activation of astrocytes and microglia. Among the cells being studied to unveil these toxic mechanisms are pericytes, cells that help keep the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and blood-spinal cord barrier.

31022419,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron (MN) death that leads to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. When symptoms become clinically evident, patients and ALS model animals (mSod1<sup>G93A</sup> mice) have already lost a large portion of motor units, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism that allows for reactively normal movement despite denervation. Furthermore, it has been shown that specialized cholinergic synapses, the C-boutons, regulate activity strength of motor output in a task dependent manner. We hypothesized that the cholinergic modulation of motor neurons through C-boutons increases motor neuron excitability, and that this C-bouton associated activity increase in surviving motor neurons could compensate for motor unit loss during ALS disease progression. We first provide a thorough analysis of the muscle denervation and behavioral changes in the mSod1<sup>G93A</sup> mice using immunohistology, electrophysiology, and quantitative analysis of locomotor behavior. Then, in support of our hypothesis, we show that task dependent modulation of hindlimb muscle activation that relies on C-bouton activation diminishes as the disease progresses. Furthermore, the capability of mSod1<sup>G93A</sup> mice to walk at higher speeds on a treadmill decreases significantly at younger ages when C-boutons are silenced. Our observations that C-bouton modulation of motor neurons is involved in compensation during ALS disease progression can have significant therapeutic implications for sustaining mobility and preserving the quality of life in human ALS patients.",2019

Different ALS disease mechanisms have been identified and recent evidence supports a prominent role for defects in intracellular transport. Several different ALS-causing gene mutations (e.g., in FUS, TDP-43, or C9ORF72) have been linked to defects in neuronal trafficking and a picture is emerging on how these defects may trigger disease. This review summarizes and discusses these recent findings. An overview of how endosomal and receptor trafficking are affected in ALS is followed by a description on dysregulated autophagy and ER/Golgi trafficking.

30656593,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis. Recently, VGF, a neuropeptide that is a precursor of bioactive polypeptides, was found to be decreased in ALS patients, and its inducer exerted protective effects in models of ALS. These findings suggested that VGF was involved in the pathology of ALS. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of various VGF-derived peptides in an in vitro ALS model. We applied seven VGF-derived peptides (TLQP-21, AQEE-30, AQEE-11, LQEQ-19, QEEL-16, LENY-13, and HVLL-7) to the motor neuron-derived cell line, NSC-34, expressing SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, which is one of the mutated proteins responsible for familial ALS. Nuclear staining revealed that AQEE-30 and LQEQ-19, which are derived from the C-terminal polypeptide of the VGF precursor protein, attenuated neuronal cell death. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that LQEQ-19 promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and inhibiting these mitogen-activated MAP kinases (MAPKs) with phosphoinositide 3-kinase or MEK/ERK inhibitors, eliminated the neuroprotective effects of LQEQ-19. In conclusion, these results suggest that VGF C-terminal peptides exert their neuroprotective effects via activation of MAPKs such as Akt and ERK1/2.

30193933,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, paralysis, and death. Although its neuropathology is well investigated, currently, effective treatments are unavailable. The mechanism of ALS involves the aggregation and accumulation of several mutant proteins, including mutant copper‑zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) proteins. Previous reports have shown that excessive oxidative stress, associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and mutant protein accumulation, contributes to ALS pathology. The present study focuses on the promotion of SOD1 misfolding and aggregation by oxidative stress. Having recently synthesized novel organic gem-dihydroperoxides (DHPs) with high anti-oxidant activity, we now examined whether DHPs reduce the mutant SOD1-induced intracellular aggregates involved in oxidative stress. We found that, among DHPs, 12AC2O significantly inhibited mutant SOD1-induced cell death and reduced the intracellular mutant SOD1 aggregates. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining with redox-sensitive dyes showed that 12AC2O reduced the excessive level of intracellular mutant SOD1-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, ESR analysis showed that 12AC2O exerts a direct scavenging effect against the hydroxyl radical (OH) and the superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sub>-</sub>).

29981425,"Recent studies described a critical role for microglia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where these CNS-resident immune cells participate in the establishment of an inflammatory microenvironment that contributes to motor neuron degeneration.

The intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 has been reported to modulate the ""pro-inflammatory"" phenotype of microglia in different pathological conditions. We here investigated the effects of blocking KCa3.1 activity in the hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup>ALS mouse model, which recapitulates many features of the human disease. We report that treatment of hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice with a selective KCa3.1 inhibitor, 1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole (TRAM-34), attenuates the ""pro-inflammatory"" phenotype of microglia in the spinal cord, reduces motor neuron death, delays onset of muscle weakness, and increases survival. Specifically, inhibition of KCa3.1 channels slowed muscle denervation, decreased the expression of the fetal acetylcholine receptor γ subunit and reduced neuromuscular junction damage.

The etiopathological causes are still largely obscure, although astrocytes definitely play a role in neuronal damage. Several mechanisms have been proposed to concur to neurodegeneration in ALS, including mitochondrial dysfunction. We have previously shown profound modifications of glutamate release and presynaptic plasticity in the spinal cord of the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. In this work, we characterized, for the first time, the aerobic metabolism in two specific compartments actively involved in neurotransmission (i.e. the presynaptic district, using purified synaptosomes, and the perisynaptic astrocyte processes, using purified gliosomes) in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at different stages of the disease. ATP/AMP ratio was lower in synaptosomes isolated from the spinal cord, but not from other brain areas, of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> vs. control mice. The energy impairment was linked to altered oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and increment of lipid peroxidation. These metabolic dysfunctions were present during disease progression, starting at the very pre-symptomatic stages, and did not depend on a different number of mitochondria or a different expression of OxPhos proteins. Conversely, gliosomes showed a reduction of the ATP/AMP ratio only at the late stages of the disease and an increment of oxidative stress also in the absence of a significant decrement in OxPhos activity. Data suggest that the presynaptic neuronal moiety plays a pivotal role for synaptic energy metabolism dysfunctions in ALS. Changes in the perisynaptic compartment seem subordinated to neuronal damage.",2018

Therefore, mechanical response of differentiated myotubes from primary cultures of mice, expressing the ALS-causing SOD1 <sup>G93A</sup> mutation, was examined by atomic force microscopy. Simultaneous acquisition of topography and cell elasticity of ALS myotubes was performed by force mapping method, compared with healthy myotubes and supplemented with immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR studies. Wild type myotubes reveal a significant difference in elasticity between a narrow and a wide population, consistent with maturation occurring with higher actin expression relative to myosin together with larger myotube width. However, this is not true for SOD1 <sup>G93A</sup> expressing myotubes, where a significant shift of thin population towards higher elastic modulus values was observed.

29606582,"Diversified neurons are essential for sensorimotor function, but whether astrocytes become specialized to optimize circuit performance remains unclear. Large fast α-motor neurons (FαMNs) of spinal cord innervate fast-twitch muscles that generate peak strength. We report that ventral horn astrocytes express the inward-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir4.1 (a.k.a. Kcnj10) around MNs in a VGLUT1-dependent manner. Loss of astrocyte-encoded Kir4.1 selectively altered FαMN size and function and led to reduced peak strength. Overexpression of Kir4.1 in astrocytes was sufficient to increase MN size through activation of the PI3K/mTOR/pS6 pathway. Kir4.1 was downregulated cell autonomously in astrocytes derived from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with SOD1 mutation. However, astrocyte Kir4.1 was dispensable for FαMN survival even in the mutant SOD1 background. These findings show that astrocyte Kir4.1 is essential for maintenance of peak strength and suggest that Kir4.1 downregulation might uncouple symptoms of muscle weakness from MN cell death in diseases like ALS.",2018
29569488,"In addition to muscle weakness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures. The SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N = 9-10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (-54%), thinner trabeculae (-41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (-17%) and cortical area (-18%) compared to control mice (all p < 0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (-27%) and failure moment (-41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (-18%) (all p < 0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in patients in ALS. Importantly, our results provide strong rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients with advanced disease.",2018

29322304,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease caused by the degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Several molecular pathways have been implicated, such as glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, defects in cytoskeletal dynamics and axonal transport, disruption of RNA metabolism, and impairments in proteostasis. ALS is associated with protein accumulation in the cytoplasm of cells undergoing neurodegeneration, which is a hallmark of the disease. In this review, we focus on mechanisms of proteostasis, particularly protein degradation, and discuss how they are related to the genetics of ALS. Indeed, the genetic bases of the disease with the implication of more than 30 genes associated with familial ALS to date, together with the important increase in understanding of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, proteasomal degradation, and autophagy, allow researchers to better understand the mechanisms underlying the selective death of motor neurons in ALS. It is clear that defects in proteostasis are involved in this type of cellular degeneration, but whether or not these mechanisms are primary causes or merely consequential remains to be clearly demonstrated. Novel cellular and animal models allowing chronic expression of mutant proteins, for example, are required. Further studies linking genetic discoveries in ALS to mechanisms of protein clearance will certainly be crucial in order to accelerate translational and clinical research towards new therapeutic targets and strategies.",2018
29241710,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most prevalent neuromuscular disease worldwide. It is a lethal and progressive neurodegenerative disease, principally affecting motor neurons; patient clinical characteristics are muscle weakness, dysphagia and respiratory failure. The mean age is related to family history (40years, familial ALS or FALS) or with no family history (50years), but it is more common in people aged 60-69years. The cause of ALS is not known and it is not known yet why it affects some people and not others. However expert consensus is that molecular alterations in different cells are involved in the development and progression of the disease. For example, motor neuron death is caused by a variety of cellular defects, including the processing of RNA molecules, water channels, and calcium levels, increasing evidence that these alterations of cells in the nervous system play an important role in ALS. Here we will systematically examine different genes (AQP1, SLC14A1, MT1X, DSCR1L1, PCP4, UCHL1, GABRA1, EGR1, OLFM1 and VSNL1) that are ""up or down"" regulated in the motor cortex and spinal cord and their association with ALS risk. These could be novel biomarkers associated with ALS risk. We built an interaction Network with Cytoscape, this was used to identify pathways, miRNA and drugs associated to ALS. The most important affected pathway is PI3K-Akt signaling. Thirteen microRNAs (miRNA-19B1, miRNA-107, miRNA-124-1, miRNA-124-2, miRNA-9-2, miRNA-29A, miRNA-9-3, miRNA-328, miRNA-19B2, miRNA-29B2, miRNA-124-3, miRNA-15A and miRNA-9-1) and four drugs (Estradiol, Acetaminophen, Progesterone and resveratrol) for new possible treatments were identified.",2018
28856708,"Spasticity occurs in a wide range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, after trauma, and after stroke, and is characterized by increased reflexes leading to muscle hypertonia. Spasticity is a painful symptom and can severely restrict everyday life, but might also participate in maintaining a low level of motor function in severely impaired patients. Constitutive activity of the serotonin receptors 5-HT<sub>2B/C</sub> is required for the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury and during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought here to provide direct evidence for a role of brainstem serotonin neurons in spasticity.",2017
28840473,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of unknown origin and characterized by a relentless loss of motor neurons that causes a progressive muscle weakness until death. Among the several pathogenic mechanisms that have been related to ALS, a dysregulation of calcium-buffering proteins in motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord can make these neurons more vulnerable to disease progression. Downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) is a neuronal calcium-binding protein that plays multiple roles in the nucleus and cytosol. The main aim of this study was focused on the characterization of DREAM and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) in the brain and spinal cord tissues from transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice and ALS patients to unravel its potential role under neurodegenerative conditions. The DREAM and GFAP levels in the spinal cord and different brain areas from transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice and ALS patients were analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest that the calcium-dependent excitotoxicity progressively enhanced in the CNS in ALS could modulate the multifunctional nature of DREAM, strengthening its apoptotic way of action in both motor neurons and astrocytes, which could act as an additional factor to increase neuronal damage. The direct crosstalk between astrocytes and motor neurons can become vulnerable under neurodegenerative conditions, and DREAM could act as an additional switch to enhance motor neuron loss. Together, these findings could pave the way to further study the molecular targets of DREAM to find novel therapeutic strategies to fight ALS.",2018
28583855,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease involving motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. ALS leads to progressive, aggravated muscle weakness and paralysis. Although the precise pathogenesis remains unknown, several studies have shown that estrogens exert neuroprotective effects during the course of the disease. Aromatase is the key enzyme in estrogen synthesis. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blotting to observe the characteristics of aromatase expression in the spinal cords of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1)-G93A transgenic mice. Under normal and nearly normal (pre-symptomatic stage) conditions, the motor neurons in the spinal anterior horn expressed aromatase. After disease onset, astrocytes began to express aromatase. The total level of aromatase expression decreased with disease progression. These findings may provide the basis for the pathogenesis of ALS through glial aromatization during the progression of this disease.",2017
28468939,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the motor system and presents with progressive muscle weakness. Most patients survive for only 2-5 years after disease onset, often due to failure of the respiratory muscles. ALS is a familial disease in ∼10% of patients, with the remaining 90% developing sporadic ALS. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in our understanding of the genetics and neuropathology of ALS. To date, around 20 genes are associated with ALS, with the most common causes of typical ALS associated with mutations in <i>SOD1</i>, <i>TARDBP</i>, <i>FUS</i> and <i>C9orf72</i> Advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of ALS have led to the creation of different models of this disease. The molecular pathways that have emerged from these systems are more heterogeneous than previously anticipated, ranging from protein aggregation and defects in multiple key cellular processes in neurons, to dysfunction of surrounding non-neuronal cells. Here, we review the different model systems used to study ALS and discuss how they have contributed to our current knowledge of ALS disease mechanisms. A better understanding of emerging disease pathways, the detrimental effects of the various gene mutations and the causes underlying motor neuron denegation in sporadic ALS will accelerate progress in the development of novel treatments.",2017
28342750,"Downregulation in the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and mutant SOD1 mouse models of ALS is believed to contribute to the death of motor neurons by excitotoxicity. We previously reported that caspase-3 cleaves EAAT2 at a unique cleavage consensus site located in its c-terminus domain, a proteolytic cleavage that also occurs in vivo in the mutant SOD1 mouse model of ALS and leads to accumulation of a sumoylated EAAT2 C-terminus fragment (CTE-SUMO1) beginning around onset of disease. CTE-SUMO1 accumulates in PML nuclear bodies of astrocytes and causes them to alter their mature phenotypes and secrete factors toxic to motor neurons. Here, we report that mutating the caspase-3 consensus site in the EAAT2 sequence with an aspartate to asparagine mutation (D504N), thereby inhibiting caspase-3 cleavage of EAAT2, confers protection to the SOD1-G93A mouse. EAAT2-D504N knock-in mutant mice were generated and crossed with SOD1-G93A mice to assess the in vivo pathogenic relevance for ALS symptoms of EAAT2 cleavage. The mutation did not affect normal EAAT2 function nor non-ALS mice. In agreement with the timing of CTE-SUMO1 accumulation, while onset of disease was not affected, the mutation caused an extension in progression time, a delay in the development of hindlimb and forelimb muscle weakness, and a significant increase in the lifespan of SOD1-G93A mice.",2017
28315275,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS ) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting spinal cord and brain motoneurons , leading to paralysis and early death. Multiple etiopathogenic mechanisms appear to contribute in the development of ALS , including glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress , protein misfolding, mitochondrial defects, impaired axonal transport, inflammation and glial cell alterations. The Sigma-1 receptor is highly expressed in motoneurons of the spinal cord, particularly enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at postsynaptic cisternae of cholinergic C-terminals. Several evidences point to participation of Sigma-1R alterations in motoneuron degeneration. Thus, mutations of the transmembrane domain of the Sigma-1R have been described in familial ALS cases. Interestingly, Sigma-1R KO mice display muscle weakness and motoneuron loss. On the other hand, Sigma-1R agonists promote neuroprotection and neurite elongation through activation of protein kinase C on motoneurons in vitro and in vivo after ventral root avulsion. Remarkably, treatment of SOD1 mice, the most usual animal model of ALS , with Sigma-1R agonists resulted in significantly enhanced motoneuron function and preservation, and increased animal survival. Sigma-1R activation also reduced microglial reactivity and increased the glial expression of neurotrophic factors. Two main interconnected mechanisms seem to underlie the effects of Sigma-1R manipulation on motoneurons: modulation of neuronal excitability and regulation of calcium homeostasis. In addition, Sigma-1R also contributes to regulating protein degradation, and reducing oxidative stress. Therefore, the multi-functional nature of the Sigma-1R represents an attractive target for treating aspects of ALS and other motoneuron diseases .",2017
28148298,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons, resulting in progressive muscle weakness and death by respiratory failure. Protein and RNA aggregates are a hallmark of ALS pathology and are thought to contribute to ALS by impairing axonal transport. Mutations in several genes known to contribute to ALS result in deposition of their protein products as aggregates; these include TARDBP, C9ORF72, and SOD1. In motor neurons, this can disrupt transport of mitochondria to areas of metabolic need, resulting in damage to cells and can elicit a neuroinflammatory response leading to further neuronal damage. Recently, eight independent human genetics studies have uncovered a link between TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) mutations and ALS. TBK1 belongs to the IKK-kinase family of kinases that are involved in innate immunity signaling pathways; specifically, TBK1 is an inducer of type-1 interferons. TBK1 also has a major role in autophagy and mitophagy, chiefly the phosphorylation of autophagy adaptors. Several other ALS genes are also involved in autophagy, including p62 and OPTN. TBK1 is required for efficient cargo recruitment in autophagy; mutations in TBK1 may result in impaired autophagy and contribute to the accumulation of protein aggregates and ALS pathology. In this review, we focus on the role of TBK1 in autophagy and the contributions of this process to the pathophysiology of ALS.",2017
28130314,"G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeat expansions within the <i>C9ORF72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These bidirectionally transcribed expansions lead to (1) the accumulation of sense G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and antisense G<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub> repeat-containing RNA, (2) the production of proteins of repeating dipeptides through unconventional translation of these transcripts, and (3) decreased <i>C9ORF72</i> mRNA and protein expression. Consequently, there is ample opportunity for the <i>C9ORF72</i> mutation to give rise to a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from muscle weakness and atrophy to changes in behavior and cognition. It is thus somewhat surprising that investigations of these three seemingly disparate events often converge on similar putative pathological mechanisms. This review aims to summarize the findings and questions emerging from the field's quest to decipher how <i>C9ORF72</i> repeat expansions cause the devastating diseases collectively referred to as ""c9ALS/FTD.""",2018
28096265,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the deterioration of motor neurons. The first symptoms of ALS always begin at a focal but variable site and consistently spread to neighboring regions, suggesting that neurodegeneration in ALS is an orderly and propagating process. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, misfolding of a specific protein is central to ALS. SOD1, the major constituent of the protein deposits in some familial and sporadic forms of ALS, propagates its misfolded conformation like prions, providing a plausible molecular basis for the focality and spreading of muscle weakness in ALS. Because protein misfolding is a common cause of diverse neurodegenerative diseases, strategies aimed at boosting a cell's ability to cope with misfolded proteins could lead to therapeutics to combat these devastating age-related proteinopathies.",2017
28058507,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterised by a loss of upper and lower motor neurons and characteristic muscle weakness and wasting, the most common form being sporadic disease with neuronal inclusions containing the tar DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is characterised by atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes, the most common clinical form being the behavioural variant, in which neuronal inclusions containing either TDP-43 or 3-repeat tau are most prevalent. Although the genetic mutations associated with these diseases have allowed various experimental models to be developed, the initial genetic forms identified remain the most common models employed to date. It is now known that these first models faithfully recapitulate only some aspects of these diseases and do not represent the majority of cases or the most common overlapping pathologies. Newer models targeting the main molecular pathologies are still rare and in some instances, lack significant aspects of the molecular pathology. However, these diseases are complex and multigenic, indicating that experimental models may need to be targeted to different disease aspects. This would allow information to be gleaned from a variety of different yet relevant models, each of which has the capacity to capture a certain aspect of the disease, and together will enable a more complete understanding of these complex and multi-layered diseases.",2017
27956443,"Descriptions of motor neuron disease (MND) documented more than a century ago remain instantly recognisable to the physician. The muscle weakness, typically with signs of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, is uniquely relentless. Over the last 30 years, a wider cerebral pathology has emerged, despite the lack of overt cognitive impairment in the majority of patients. From the initial linkage of a small number of cases to mutations in SOD1, diverse cellular pathways have been implicated in pathogenesis. An increasingly complex clinical heterogeneity has emerged around a significant variability in survival. Defining a cellular signature of aggregated TDP-43 common to nearly all MND and a large proportion of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), has placed MND alongside more traditional cerebral neurodegeneration. With new genetic causes, most notably a hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 associated with both MND and FTD, the development of biomarkers against which to test therapeutic candidates is a priority.",2016
27488828,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by the death of upper (corticospinal) and lower motor neurons (MNs) with progressive muscle weakness. This incurable disease is clinically heterogeneous and its aetiology remains unknown. Increased excitability of corticospinal MNs has been observed prior to symptoms in human and rodent studies. Increased excitability has been correlated with structural changes in neuronal dendritic arbors and spines for decades. Here, using a modified Golgi-Cox staining method, we have made the first longitudinal study examining the dendrites of pyramidal neurons from the motor cortex, medial pre-frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex and entorhinal cortex of hSOD1(G93A) (SOD1) mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermate controls at postnatal (P) days 8-15, 28-35, 65-75 and 120. Progressive decreases in dendritic length and spine density commencing at pre-symptomatic ages (P8-15 or P28-35) were observed in layer V pyramidal neurons within the motor cortex and medial pre-frontal cortex of SOD1 mice compared to WT mice. Spine loss without concurrent dendritic pathology was present in the pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex from disease-onset (P65-75). Our results from the SOD1 model suggest that dendritic and dendritic spine changes foreshadow and underpin the neuromotor phenotypes present in ALS and may contribute to the varied cognitive, executive function and extra-motor symptoms commonly seen in ALS patients. Determining if these phenomena are compensatory or maladaptive may help explain differential susceptibility of neurons to degeneration in ALS.",2016
27389143,"Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeNPs) neutralize reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Since oxidative stress plays a role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in humans and in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, we tested whether administration of CeNPs would improve survival and reduce disease severity in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice. Twice a week intravenous treatment of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice with CeNPs started at the onset of muscle weakness preserved muscle function and increased longevity in males and females. Median survival after the onset of CeNP treatment was 33.0±3.7days (N=20), and only 22.0±2.5days in mice treated with vehicle, control injections (N=27; P=0.022). Since these citrate-EDTA stabilized CeNPs exhibited catalase and oxidase activity in cell-free systems and in in vitro models of ischemic oxidative stress, we hypothesize that antioxidant activity is the protective mechanism prolonging survival in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.",2016
27242430,"The etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal motor neuron disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and spasticity, remains largely unknown. Approximately 5-10% of cases are familial, and of those, 15-20% are associated with mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Mutations of the SOD1 gene interrupt cellular homeostasis and contribute to cellular toxicity evoked by the presence of altered SOD1, along with other toxic species, such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs trigger activation of their chief cell surface receptor, RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products), and induce RAGE-dependent cellular stress and inflammation in neurons, thereby affecting their function and leading to apoptosis. Here, we show for the first time that the expression of RAGE is higher in the SOD1 transgenic mouse model of ALS vs. wild-type mouse spinal cord. We tested whether pharmacological blockade of RAGE may delay the onset and progression of disease in this mouse model. Our findings reveal that treatment of SOD1 transgenic mice with soluble RAGE (sRAGE), a natural competitor of RAGE that sequesters RAGE ligands and blocks their interaction with cell surface RAGE, significantly delays the progression of ALS and prolongs life span compared to vehicle treatment. We demonstrate that in sRAGE-treated SOD1 transgenic animals at the final stage of the disease, a significantly higher number of neurons and lower number of astrocytes is detectable in the spinal cord. We conclude that RAGE antagonism may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ALS intervention.",2016
27090969,"We describe a Japanese man with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with a p.Cys146Arg mutation in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1). The patient developed bulbar signs followed by rapidly progressive limb muscle weakness. The prominent clinical feature was orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure, which occurred after he underwent tracheostomy 1 year and 3 months after the onset. Thereafter, he required mechanical ventilation and progressed to communication stage V (totally locked-in state) 7 years after the onset. Neuropathology showed ALS with posterior column degeneration and multiple system degeneration. Severe neuronal loss in the intermediolateral nucleus was also observed. Two previously reported cases of ALS patients with autonomic failure showed severe neuronal loss in the intermediolateral nucleus in addition to degeneration of the motor neurons. Thus, autonomic failure due to neuronal loss in the intermediolateral nucleus could present in patients with ALS associated with certain mutations in SOD1.",2016

26469273,"Edaravone, a free radical scavenger is used widely in Japanese patients with acute cerebral infarction. This antioxidant could have therapeutic potentials for other neurological diseases. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the upper and the lower motor neuron, leading to death within 3-5 years after onset. A phase III clinical trial of edaravone suggested no significant effects in ALS patients. However, recent 2nd double-blind trial has demonstrated therapeutic benefits of edaravone in definite patients diagnosed by revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria of ALS. Two previous studies showed that edaravone attenuated motor symptoms or motor neuron degeneration in mutant superoxide dismutase 1-transgenic mice or rats, animal models of familial ALS. Herein we examined whether this radical scavenger can retard progression of motor dysfunction and neuropathological changes in wobbler mice, sporadic ALS-like model. After diagnosis of the disease onset at the postnatal age of 3-4 weeks, wobbler mice received edaravone (1 or 10 mg/kg, n = 10/group) or vehicle (n = 10), daily for 4 weeks by intraperitoneal administration. Motor symptoms and neuropathological changes were compared among three groups. Higher dose (10 mg/kg) of edaravone treatment significantly attenuated muscle weakness and contracture in the forelimbs, and suppressed denervation atrophy in the biceps muscle and degeneration in the cervical motor neurons compared to vehicle. Previous and the present studies indicated neuroprotective effects of edaravone in three rodent ALS-like models. This drug seems to be worth performing the clinical trial in ALS patients in the United States of American and Europe, in addition to Japan.",2015

These changes at the NMJ share many of the common features observed in the NMJs of aged mice. In this review, research findings demonstrating the effects of PGC-1α, IGF-1, GDNF, MyoD, myogenin, and miR-206 on NMJ innervation patterns in the G93A SOD1 mice will be highlighted in the context of age-related muscle denervation.",2015
26303227,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by motor neurone loss resulting in muscle weakness, spasticity and ultimately death. 5-10% are caused by inherited mutations, most commonly C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. Rarer genetic causes of ALS include mutation of optineurin (mt OPTN). Furthermore, optineurin protein has been localized to the ubiquitylated aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. This study: (i) investigated the frequency of mt OPTN in ALS patients in England; (ii) characterized the clinical and neuropathological features of ALS associated with a mt OPTN; and (iii) investigated optineurin neuropathology in C9ORF72-related ALS (C9ORF72-ALS). We identified a heterozygous p.E322K missense mutation in exon 10 of OPTN in one familial ALS patient who additionally had a C9ORF72 mutation. This patient had bulbar, limb and respiratory disease without cognitive problems. Neuropathology revealed motor neurone loss, trans-activation response DNA protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions together with TDP-43-negative neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in extra motor regions that are characteristic of C9ORF72-ALS. We have demonstrated that both TDP-43-positive and negative inclusion types had positive staining for optineurin by immunohistochemistry. We went on to show that optineurin was present in TDP-43-negative cytoplasmic extra motor inclusions in C9ORF72-ALS cases that do not carry mt OPTN. We conclude that: (i) OPTN mutations are associated with ALS; (ii) optineurin protein is present in a subset of the extramotor inclusions of C9ORF72-ALS; (iii) It is not uncommon for multiple ALS-causing mutations to occur in the same patient; and (iv) studies of optineurin are likely to provide useful dataregarding the pathophysiology of ALS and neurodegeneration.",2016

Albeit the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease remain unknown, growing evidence suggests that skeletal muscle can be a target of ALS toxicity. In particular, the two main intracellular degradation mechanisms, autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradative system (UPS) have been poorly studied in this tissue. In this study we investigated the activation of autophagy and the UPS as well as apoptosis in the skeletal muscle from SOD1G93A mice along disease progression. Our results showed a significant upregulation of proteasome activity at early symptomatic stage, while the autophagy activation was found at presymptomatic and terminal stages. The mRNA upregulated levels of LC3, p62, Beclin1, Atg5 and E2f1 were only observed at symptomatic and terminal stages, which reinforced the time-point activation of autophagy. Furthermore, no apoptosis activation was observed along disease progression. The combined data provided clear evidence for the first time that there is a time-point dependent activation of autophagy and UPS in the skeletal muscle from SOD1G93A mice.",2015
26084911,"Postactivation depression (PActD) of Ia afferent excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in spinal motoneurons results in a long-lasting depression of the stretch reflex. This phenomenon (PActD) is of clinical interest as it has been shown to be reduced in a number of spastic disorders. Using in vivo intracellular recordings of Ia EPSPs in adult mice, we demonstrate that PActD in adult (100-220 days old) C57BL/6J mice is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that which has been observed in larger animals with respect to both the magnitude (with ∼20% depression of EPSPs at 0.5 ms after a train of stimuli) and the time course (returning to almost normal amplitudes by 5 ms after the train). This validates the use of mouse models to study PActD. Changes in such excitatory inputs to spinal motoneurons may have important implications for hyperreflexia and/or glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). With the use of the G127X SOD1 mutant mouse, an ALS model with a prolonged asymptomatic phase and fulminant symptom onset, we observed that PActD is significantly reduced at both presymptomatic (16% depression) and symptomatic (17.3% depression) time points compared with aged-matched controls (22.4% depression). The PActD reduction was not markedly altered by symptom onset. Comparing these PActD changes at the EPSP with the known effect of the depression on the monosynaptic reflex, we conclude that this is likely to have a much larger effect on the reflex itself (a 20-40% difference). Nevertheless, it should also be accounted that in aged (580 day old) C57BL/6J mice there was also a reduction in PActD although, aging is not usually associated with spasticity.",2015
26041991,"Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are one of the genetic causes of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Although the primary symptom of ALS is muscle weakness, the link between SOD1 mutations, cellular dysfunction and muscle atrophy and weakness is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to characterize cellular markers of ER stress in skeletal muscle across the lifespan of G93A*SOD1 (ALS-Tg) mice. Muscles were obtained from ALS-Tg and age-matched wild type (WT) mice at 70d (pre-symptomatic), 90d and 120-140d (symptomatic) and analyzed for ER stress markers. In white gastrocnemius (WG) muscle, ER stress sensors PERK and IRE1α were upregulated ~2-fold at 70d and remained (PERK) or increased further (IRE1α) at 120-140d. Phospho-eIF2α, a downstream target of PERK and an inhibitor of protein translation, was increased by 70d and increased further to 12.9-fold at 120-140d. IRE1α upregulation leads to increased splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) to the XBP-1s isoform. XBP-1s transcript was increased at 90d and 120-140d indicating activation of IRE1α signaling. The ER chaperone/heat shock protein Grp78/BiP was upregulated 2-fold at 70d and 90d and increased to 6.1-fold by 120-140d. The ER-stress-specific apoptotic signaling protein CHOP was upregulated 2-fold at 70d and 90d and increased to 13.3-fold at 120-140d indicating progressive activation of an apoptotic signal in muscle. There was a greater increase in Grp78/BiP and CHOP in WG vs. the more oxidative red gastrocnemius (RG) ALS-Tg at 120-140d indicating greater ER stress and apoptosis in fast glycolytic muscle. These data show that the ER stress response is activated in skeletal muscle of ALS-Tg mice by an early pre-symptomatic age and increases with disease progression. These data suggest a mechanism by which myocellular ER stress leads to reduced protein translation and contributes to muscle atrophy and weakness in ALS.",2015

Application of Y-27632 to primary motoneurons in vitro increased survival and promoted neurite outgrowth. In vivo, SOD1(G93A) mice were orally treated with 2 or 30 mg/kg body weight of Y-27632. The 2 mg/kg group did not benefit from Y-27632 treatment, whereas treatment with 30 mg/kg resulted in improved motor function in male mice. Female mice showed only limited improvement and overall survival was not modified in both 2 and 30 mg/kg Y-27632 groups. In conclusion, we provide evidence that inhibition of ROCK by Y-27632 is neuroprotective in vitro but has limited beneficial effects in vivo being restricted to male mice. Therefore, the evaluation of ROCK inhibitors in preclinical models of ALS should always take gender differences into account.",2014
25277755,"Although the precise signaling mechanisms underlying the vulnerability of some sub-populations of motoneurons in ALS remain unclear, critical factors such as metallo-proteinase 9 expression, neuronal activity and endoplasmic reticulum stress have been shown to be involved. In the context of SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model, we previously showed that a two-fold decrease in calreticulin (CRT) is occurring in the vulnerable fast motoneurons. Here, we asked to which extent the decrease in CRT levels was causative to muscle denervation and/or motoneuron degeneration. Toward this goal, a hemizygous deletion of the crt gene in SOD1(G93A) mice was generated since the complete ablation of crt is embryonic lethal. We observed that SOD1(G93A);crt(+/-) mice display increased and earlier muscle weakness and muscle denervation compared to SOD1(G93A) mice. While CRT reduction in motoneurons leads to a strong upregulation of two factors important in motoneuron dysfunction, ER stress and mTOR activation, it does not aggravate motoneuron death. Our results underline a prevalent role for CRT levels in the early phase of muscle denervation and support CRT regulation as a potential therapeutic approach.",2015
25266783,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and death, most often from respiratory failure. Over 200 pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione (PYT) small molecules, which prevent aggregation and reduce the associated toxicity of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) found in patients with familial ALS, have been synthesized and tested. One of the compounds (1,3-bis(2-phenylethyl)pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione, (1) was previously found to have an excellent combination of potency efficacy, and some desirable pharmacokinetic properties. To improve the solubility and metabolic stability properties of this compound, deuterium and fluorine were introduced into 1. New analogs with better solubility, plasma stability, and human microsome stability were identified.",2014
25252949,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness, ultimately leading to respiratory failure. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling and intracellular Ca(2+) handling during disease progression in the G93A*SOD1 ALS transgenic (ALS Tg) mouse model. To assess E-C coupling, single muscle fibers were electrically stimulated (10-150 Hz), and intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration was assessed using fura-2. There were no differences in peak fura-2 ratio at any stimulation frequency at 70 days (early presymptomatic). However, at 90 days (late presymptomatic) and 120-140 days (symptomatic), fura-2 ratio was increased at 10 Hz in ALS Tg compared with wild-type (WT) fibers (0.670 ± 0.02 vs. 0.585 ± 0.02 for 120-140 days; P < 0.05). There was also a significant increase in resting fura-2 ratio at 90 days (0.351 ± 0.008 vs. 0.390 ± 0.009 in WT vs. ALS Tg; P < 0.05) and 120-140 days (0.374 ± 0.001 vs. 0.415 ± 0.003 in WT vs. ALS Tg; P < 0.05). These increases in intracellular Ca(2+) in ALS Tg muscle were associated with reductions in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase proteins SERCA1 (to 54% and 19% of WT) and SERCA2 (to 56% and 11% of WT) and parvalbumin (to 80 and 62% of WT) in gastrocnemius muscle at 90 and 120-140 days, respectively. There was no change in dihydropyridine receptor/l-type Ca(2+) channel at any age. Overall, these data demonstrate minimal changes in electrically evoked Ca(2+) transients but elevations in intracellular Ca(2+) attributable to decreased Ca(2+)-clearance proteins. These data suggest that elevations in cellular Ca(2+) could contribute to muscle weakness during disease progression in ALS mice.",2014
25132468,"A repeat expansion in C9ORF72 causes frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (c9FTD/ALS). RNA of the expanded repeat (r(GGGGCC)exp) forms nuclear foci or undergoes repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation, producing ""c9RAN proteins."" Since neutralizing r(GGGGCC)exp could inhibit these potentially toxic events, we sought to identify small-molecule binders of r(GGGGCC)exp. Chemical and enzymatic probing of r(GGGGCC)8 indicate that it adopts a hairpin structure in equilibrium with a quadruplex structure. Using this model, bioactive small molecules targeting r(GGGGCC)exp were designed and found to significantly inhibit RAN translation and foci formation in cultured cells expressing r(GGGGCC)66 and neurons transdifferentiated from fibroblasts of repeat expansion carriers. Finally, we show that poly(GP) c9RAN proteins are specifically detected in c9ALS patient cerebrospinal fluid. Our findings highlight r(GGGGCC)exp-binding small molecules as a possible c9FTD/ALS therapeutic and suggest that c9RAN proteins could potentially serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to assess efficacy of therapies that target r(GGGGCC)exp.",2014
25061944,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons causing progressive muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventual death from respiratory failure. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for ALS. Besides motor neuron degeneration, ALS is associated with impaired energy metabolism, which is pathophysiologically linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate excitotoxicity. The Deanna Protocol (DP) is a metabolic therapy that has been reported to alleviate symptoms in patients with ALS. In this study we hypothesized that alternative fuels in the form of TCA cycle intermediates, specifically arginine-alpha-ketoglutarate (AAKG), the main ingredient of the DP, and the ketogenic diet (KD), would increase motor function and survival in a mouse model of ALS (SOD1-G93A). ALS mice were fed standard rodent diet (SD), KD, or either diets containing a metabolic therapy of the primary ingredients of the DP consisting of AAKG, gamma-aminobutyric acid, Coenzyme Q10, and medium chain triglyceride high in caprylic triglyceride. Assessment of ALS-like pathology was performed using a pre-defined criteria for neurological score, accelerated rotarod test, paw grip endurance test, and grip strength test. Blood glucose, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate, and body weight were also monitored. SD+DP-fed mice exhibited improved neurological score from age 116 to 136 days compared to control mice. KD-fed mice exhibited better motor performance on all motor function tests at 15 and 16 weeks of age compared to controls. SD+DP and KD+DP therapies significantly extended survival time of SOD1-G93A mice by 7.5% (p = 0.001) and 4.2% (p = 0.006), respectively. Sixty-three percent of mice in the KD+DP and 72.7% of the SD+DP group lived past 125 days, while only 9% of the control animals survived past that point. Targeting energy metabolism with metabolic therapy produces a therapeutic effect in ALS mice which may prolong survival and quality of life in ALS patients.",2014
25042397,"Disease processes and trauma affecting nerve-evoked muscle activity, motor neurons, synapses and myofibers cause different levels of muscle weakness, i.e., reduced maximal force production in response to voluntary activation or nerve stimulation. However, the mechanisms of muscle weakness are not well known. Using murine models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice), congenital myasthenic syndrome (AChE knockout mice and Musk(V789M/-) mutant mice), Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (Hspg2(C1532YNEO/C1532YNEO) mutant mice) and traumatic nerve injury (Neurotomized wild-type mice), we show that the reduced maximal activation capacity (the ability of the nerve to maximally activate the muscle) explains 52%, 58% and 100% of severe weakness in respectively SOD1(G93A), Neurotomized and Musk mice, whereas muscle atrophy only explains 37%, 27% and 0%. We also demonstrate that the impaired maximal activation capacity observed in SOD1, Neurotomized, and Musk mice is not highly related to Hdac4 gene upregulation. Moreover, in SOD1 and Neurotomized mice our results suggest LC3, Fn14, Bcl3 and Gadd45a as candidate genes involved in the maintenance of the severe atrophic state. In conclusion, our study indicates that muscle weakness can result from the triggering of different signaling pathways. This knowledge may be helpful in designing therapeutic strategies and finding new drug targets for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congenital myasthenic syndrome, Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and nerve injury.",2014
24838187,"Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis accounts for about 5% of all cases of the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Genetic mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been associated with one kind of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS1). We identified a novel duplication mutation in exon 1 of the SOD1 gene in a Japanese family whose members had lower motor neuron diseases. The patients showed slow disease progression, with the onset of lower limb muscle weakness and exertional dyspnea. Some patients had mild motor and sensory neuropathy and/or bladder dysfunction, which is further evidence that SOD1 mutation results in a predominantly lower motor neuron phenotype.",2014

24478630,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease manifested by progressive muscle atrophy and paralysis due to the loss of upper and lower motoneurons (MN). Spasticity appears in ALS patients leading to further disabling consequences. Loss of the inhibitory tone induced by downregulation of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) in MN has been proposed to importantly contribute to the spastic behavior after spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of the present study was to test whether the alterations in the expression of KCC2 are linked to the appearance of spasticity in the SOD(G93A) ALS murine model. We compared SOD(G93A) mice to wild type mice subjected to SCI to mimic the spinal MN disconnection from motor descending pathways, and to sciatic nerve lesion to mimic the loss of MN connectivity to muscle. Electrophysiological results show that loss of motor function is observed at presymptomatic stage (8 weeks) in SOD(G93A) mice but hyperreflexia and spasticity do not appear until a late stage (16 weeks). However, KCC2 was not downregulated despite MN suffered disconnection both from muscles and upper MNs. Further experiments revealed decreased gephyrin expression, as a general marker of inhibitory systems, accompanied by a reduction in the number of Renshaw interneurons. Moreover, 5-HT fibers were increased in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord at late stage of disease progression in SOD1(G93A) mice. Taken together, the present results indicate that spasticity appears late in the ALS model, and may be mediated by a decrease in inhibitory interneurons and an increase of 5-HT transmission, while the absence of down-regulation of KCC2 could rather indicate an inability of MNs to respond to insults.",2014
24381813,"Pathological events are well characterized in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse models, but review of the literature fails to identify a specific initiating event that precipitates disease pathology. There is now growing consensus in the field that axon and synapses are first cellular sites of degeneration, but controversy exists over whether axon and synapse loss is initiated autonomously at those sites or by pathology in the cell body, in nonneuronal cells or even in nonmotoneurons (MNs). Previous studies have identified pathological events in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) models involving spinal cord, peripheral axons, neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), or muscle; however, few studies have systematically examined pathogenesis at multiple sites in the same study. We have performed ultrastructural examination of both central and peripheral components of the neuromuscular system in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS. Twenty percent of MNs undergo degeneration by P60, but NMJ innervation in fast fatigable muscles is reduced by 40% by P30. Gait alterations and muscle weakness were also found at P30. There was no change in axonal transport prior to initial NMJ denervation. Mitochondrial morphological changes are observed at P7 and become more prominent with disease progression. At P30 there was a significant decrease in excitatory axo-dendritic and axo-somatic synapses with an increase in C-type axo-somatic synapses. Our study examined early pathology in both peripheral and central neuromuscular system. The muscle denervation is associated with functional motor deficits and begins during the first postnatal month in SOD1(G93A) mice. Physiological dysfunction and pathology in the mitochondria of synapses and MN soma and dendrites occur, and disease onset in these animals begins more than 2 months earlier than originally thought. This information may be valuable for designing preclinical trials that are more likely to impact disease onset and progression.",2013
24367722,"Oxidative stress and angiogenic factors have been placed as the prime focus of scientific investigations after an establishment of link between vascular endothelial growth factor promoter (VEGF), hypoxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. Deletion of the hypoxia-response element in the vascular endothelial growth factor promoter and mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) which are characterised by atrophy and muscle weakness resulted in phenotype resembling human ALS in mice. This results in lower motor neurodegeneration thus establishing an important link between motor neuron degeneration, vasculature, and angiogenic molecules. In this review, we have presented human, animal, and in vitro studies which suggest that molecules like VEGF have a therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic potential in ALS. Involvement of vascular growth factors and hypoxia response elements also highlights the converging role of oxidative stress and neurovascular network for understanding and treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders like ALS.",2013
24291885,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons.

In a Japanese family with familial ALS, we found the R521C FUS/TLS mutation, which has been reported to be found in various ethnic backgrounds. The family history revealed 23 patients with ALS among 46 family members, suggesting a 100% penetrance rate. They developed muscle weakness at an average age of 35.3 years, and the average age of death was 37.2 years.Neuropathological examination revealed remarkable atrophy of the brainstem tegmentum characterized by cytoplasmic basophilic inclusion bodies in the neurons of the brainstem.

23876328,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by defective levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMA causes spinal motoneuron (MN) loss, and progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. Currently, there is no effective therapy to cure this disease. Although different strategies focused on increasing the expression of functional SMN protein have been assayed, numerous SMN-independent therapeutic approaches have been demonstrated to have potential effectiveness in improving the SMA phenotype in mouse models and clinical trials. Recent works have shown that compounds which inhibit GSK-3β activity are effective in promoting MN survival and ameliorating lifespan in models of MN diseases including SMA. Taking into account the reported neuroprotective actions of lithium (Li) through the inhibition of GSK-3β in different studies, we tested here its potential efficiency as a therapeutic agent in a mouse model of severe SMA (SMNΔ7 mice). We show that the chronic treatment with Li initiated before the appearance of disease symptoms, although inhibited GSK-3β, did not improve the median survival, motor behavior, and spinal MN loss linked to SMA. Li administration did not either ameliorate the microglial and astroglial reaction in the spinal cord or the depletion of glutamatergic synapses on MNs observed in SMNΔ7 animals. Moreover, Li treatment did not mitigate muscle atrophy or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) downregulation in the neuromuscular junctions linked to the disease. However, a significant reduction in apoptotic cell death found in the skeletal muscle of SMA mice was observed after Li treatment.",2013

23577159,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting in severe muscle weakness and eventual death by respiratory failure. Although little is known about its pathogenesis, mutations in fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS) are causative for familial ALS. FUS is a multifunctional protein that is involved in many aspects of RNA processing. To elucidate the role of FUS in ALS, we overexpressed wild-type and two mutant forms of FUS in HEK-293T cells, as well as knocked-down FUS expression. This was followed by RNA-Seq to identify genes which displayed differential expression or altered splicing patterns. Pathway analysis revealed that overexpression of wild-type FUS regulates ribosomal genes, whereas knock-down of FUS additionally affects expression of spliceosome related genes. Furthermore, cells expressing mutant FUS displayed global transcription patterns more similar to cells overexpressing wild-type FUS than to the knock-down condition. This observation suggests that FUS mutants do not contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS through a loss-of-function. Finally, our results demonstrate that the R521G and R522G mutations display differences in their influence on transcription and splicing. Taken together, these results provide additional insights into the function of FUS and how mutations contribute to the development of ALS.",2013
23141412,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, eventually resulting in death because of respiratory failure. Genetic variants are thought to predispose to the disease. A recent, large, genome-wide association study identified 2 loci that increase susceptibility to ALS. These 2 loci on chromosomes 9 and 19 consist of 4 genes: UNC13a, IFNK, MOBKL2b, and C9ORF72. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the noncoding region of C9ORF72 was recently identified as the cause of chromosome 9-linked ALS-FTD (frontotemporal dementia). In this study, our aim was to determine whether the coding regions of these genes harbor rare, nonsynonymous variants that play a role in ALS pathogenesis. In DNA from 1019 sporadic ALS patients and 1103 control subjects of Dutch descent, we performed a mutation screening analysis in the coding region of these 4 genes by resequencing the exons. A total of 16 amino acid-changing rare variations were identified, 11 in UNC13a and 5 on chromosome 9. Some of these were unique to ALS, but were detected in a single patient. None of the genes showed significant enrichment of rare variants in the coding sequence. Rare variants in the coding region of UNC13a, IFNK, MOBKL2b, and C9ORF72 are unlikely to be a genetic cause of ALS.",2013
23114367,"Spasticity is a common and disabling symptom observed in patients with central nervous system diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spasticity is traditionally thought to be the result of degeneration of the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, although degeneration of other neuronal types, in particular serotonergic neurons, might also represent a cause of spasticity. We performed a pathology study in seven patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and six control subjects and observed that central serotonergic neurons suffer from a degenerative process with prominent neuritic degeneration, and sometimes loss of cell bodies in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Moreover, distal serotonergic projections to spinal cord motor neurons and hippocampus systematically degenerated in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In SOD1 (G86R) mice, a transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, serotonin levels were decreased in brainstem and spinal cord before onset of motor symptoms. Furthermore, there was noticeable atrophy of serotonin neuronal cell bodies along with neuritic degeneration at disease onset. We hypothesized that degeneration of serotonergic neurons could underlie spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and investigated this hypothesis in vivo using tail muscle spastic-like contractions in response to mechanical stimulation as a measure of spasticity. In SOD1 (G86R) mice, tail muscle spastic-like contractions were observed at end-stage. Importantly, they were abolished by 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b/c receptors inverse agonists. In line with this, 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b receptor expression was strongly increased at disease onset. In all, we show that serotonergic neurons degenerate during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and that this might underlie spasticity in mice. Further research is needed to determine whether inverse agonists of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b/c receptors could be of interest in treating spasticity in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",2013
