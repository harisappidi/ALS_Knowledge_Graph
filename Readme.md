# Constructing a Knowledge Graph to Aid Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Research

This research project focuses on constructing a Knowledge Graph (KG) to enhance the understanding of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) research. The project aims to create a visual map to understand connections between various ALS studies published on PubMed from 2013 to 2023.  The methodology involved data extraction via the Entrez API, and the utilization of NLP tools such as SpaCy and BioBERT. 

Initially, the project faced challenges in relation extraction, prompting a shift to custom rules and Stanford CoreNLP for more effective results. The generation and refinement of triples, a crucial step in this process, was accomplished using the openIE tool, followed by a stringent filtering process to eliminate redundant data.. The final KG, though not as comprehensive as initially intended, marks a significant step in structuring ALS research data. It highlights the preliminary nature of the graph and points towards future work aimed at refining the KG and enhancing its validation process. This research provides a foundation for more advanced explorations and contributes to the understanding of ALS research dynamics.
